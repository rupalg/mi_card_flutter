## My Learnings
1. Dealing with the "remote origin already exists" error: https://www.cloudbees.com/blog/remote-origin-already-exists-error
2. Understand syntax of how certain widgets are written, e.g. for https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/MainAxisAlignment.html, mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center is the appropriate syntax
3. Ctrl+J opens the quick menu for a widget on Android Studio
4. Option+Return suggests what to wrap a widget with on Android Studio

## My Questions
1. What is a “stateless widget”?
2. Why do we have to load some assets with their locations like images (e.g. backgroundImage: AssetImage('images/rupal.png’)) but for other “assets”, we can just add an asset and refer to it by name, example font families, “fontFamily: 'Pangolin’”
